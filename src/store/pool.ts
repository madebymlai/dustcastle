/**
 * The reusable GC pool interface (ADR 0012). dustcastle's GC is already a pure
 * recency/ceiling/warm-set brain behind an injected mechanism (ADR 0007); this seam
 * generalizes that mechanism into a **pool** so the SAME brain manages more than one
 * resource. In this slice the Store is the sole pool — its `nix-store --gc` /
 * `--optimise` / gc-roots are now expressed through the interface, no behavior
 * change — preparing the seam a deps-cache pool plugs into (ADR 0012, dustcastle-8od).
 *
 * A pool exposes five things the brain drives:
 *   - `measure`  — the pool's total resident size (bytes), the cap half of the ceiling;
 *   - `entries`  — its recency records `{key, lastUsedAt, bytes}`, the warm-set input;
 *   - `pin` / `release` — protect an active entry from eviction (a live run pins the
 *     entry it depends on, released on completion) — a pinned entry is NEVER evicted;
 *   - `evict`    — collect the cold keys (Store: prune cold roots, then `nix-store --gc`);
 *   - `optimise` — optional non-destructive dedup (Store: `nix store optimise`; a pool
 *     with no file-level dedup, like the deps cache, simply omits it).
 *
 * The brain (`collectPool`) is pool-agnostic: it picks the byte-budget warm tail from
 * `entries`, then evicts the rest through `evict` — the pool decides the mechanism.
